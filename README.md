# Orlando DÃ­az Torrealva

Welcome to my profile!

I am a Frontend developer and I am open to working in a company or startup that requires the work that I can offer. I consider myself a great developer because I have a passion for what I do and I would like to be allowed to show my work shows my skills. I don't have much experience in terms of professional work, but I have a great desire to grow and gain experience together with a good team in which we can achieve a common goal.
I have a great desire to become a Software Engineer in the future and you can help me with it.

In addition to working as a developer, I love playing games with other people, and learning new technologies and features that help me improve.
